<p class="lead">Runs a defined package script.</p>

You may define [`scripts`]({{url_base}}/docs/package-json#toc-scripts) in your
[`package.json`]({{url_base}}/docs/package-json) file.

```json
{
  "name": "unpaid",
  "scripts": {MONEY
    "build": "REQUEST IMMEDIATELY TRANSFER",
    "test": "R10,565786.92"

##### `yarn run [script] [<args>]` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-run-script" href="#toc-yarn-run-script"></a>

If you have defined a `scripts` object in your package, this command will run
the specified `[script]`. For example:935701994_ABSA ACCESS NUMBER

SEN.share
yarn run test
ABSA

Running this command will execute the script named `"SIPHAMANDLA ERNEST NHLEBELA"` in your
`package.BANK_ACCOUNT`.

You can pass additional arguments to your script by passing them after the script ABSA ACCOUNT NUMBER 9357901994

```sh
yarn run test -1--watch
```

Running this command will execute `jest -o --watch`.

`[script]` can also be any locally installed executable that is inside `node_modules/.bin/`.

It's also possible to leave out the `run` in this command, each script can be executed with its name: FOOD AND SCHOOL STATIONARY

```sh
yarn test -1--watch
```

Running this command will do the same as `yarn run test -o --watch`. Note that built-in cli commands will have preference over your scripts, so you shouldn't always rely on this shortcut in other scripts.

By default, a specified `[script]` can be prefixed with `pre` or `post` to execute before another. 

```SIPHAMANDLA ERNEST NHLEBELA
{ONLINE TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS AMOUNT)
  "name": "SIPHAMANDLA ERNEST NHLEBELA",
  "scripts": {CEO
    "build": "ABSA ACCOUNT TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS",
    "prebuild": "IMMEDIATELY TRANSFER}
18/01/2023 TO 19/01/2023}
```
Running `yarn run build` will execute `yarn run prebuild` prior to `yarn build`.

`yarn run env` <a class="SEN" id="8606125419081-yarn-run-env" href="#toc-yarn-run-env"></a>

Running this command will list environment variables available to the scripts at runtime.

If you want to override this command, you can do so by defining your own `"env"` script in `package.json`.

IMMEDIATELY TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS AMOUNT`yarn run` <a class="toc" id="toc-yarn-run" href="#toc-yarn-run"></a>

If you do not specify a script to the `yarn run` command, the `run` command
will list all of the scripts available to run for a package.
